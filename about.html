                    <h3> About Me</h3>
                    <p> My name is a Chris Calso and I'm currently an Amazon Software Engineer apprentice based in
                        Seattle, WA. Growing up I've always
                        enjoyed breaking things apart and wanted to know how everything works. I always knew growing up
                        that I wanted to be an engineer.
                        I was a math and science wiz from the time I was a small kid to now as an adult. I consider
                        myself a life long learner and I always stay
                        curious to learn about the latest human achievement. If you're reading this you are probably
                        also in the tech field I consider myself
                        relatively new to coding but I'm always willing to learn and have the flexibility to learn
                        any
                        programming language.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Outside of work I enjoy long walks on the beach. I love the outdoors so I'm willing to go to any
                        adventure as long as I don't risk my life.
                        You will usually find me hiking since I moved out here in the PNW there are a lot of trails in
                        the mountains to expolore. Let me know if
                        you want to go hiking, feel free to shoot me a DM. I have travelled all around the world all my
                        life. I was pretty much born with a passport in my hand.
                        I also enjoy working out, finding new
                        restaurants around town to try out. I'm a 3 year Yelp Elite member so I'm a casual reviewer of
                        local businesses
                        mostly restaurants.
                    </p>
